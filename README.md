# Character-Finder

This is a simple project for my **The Theory of Computation class**.

#### About
    It looks for a special word in a text and If it's in the text, 
    
    The output is:
        It's Here.
    Other cases:
        it's not here.
### Starting the Search
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. Enter your main text in input.txt
2. Run the command: python3 main.py

4. Wait...!
